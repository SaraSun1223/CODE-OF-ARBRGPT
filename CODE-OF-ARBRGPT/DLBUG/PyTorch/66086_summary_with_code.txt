[Title] Backwards compatibility is broken between 1.9.1 and nightly for `torch.cosine_similarity`

## 🐛 Bug

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

The function `torch.cosine_similarity` allowed tensor input of differing shapes in torch 1.9.1. In the nightly version for 1.10, this does not seem to be allowed anymore. This breaks backwards compatibility - is this intended here?

## To Reproduce

1.) Install `torch 1.9.1`:

```
pip3 install torch==1.9.1+cpu torchvision==0.10.1+cpu torchaudio==0.9.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

Run:

```python
import torch
torch.cosine_similarity(torch.ones((10, 2, 3, 4)), torch.ones((2, 3, 4)), dim=-1)
```

=> works fine

2.) Install `torch-nightly` for `torch 1.10`:

```
pip3 install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu/torch_nightly.html
```

Run the same function:

```python
import torch
torch.cosine_similarity(torch.ones((10, 2, 3, 4)), torch.ones((2, 3, 4)), dim=-1)
```

=> This function now returns an error:

```
RuntimeError: cosine_similarity requires both inputs to have the same number of dimensions, but x1 has 4 and x2 has 3
```

## Expected behavior

Is it intended that backwards compatibility is not kept here?

## Environment

 - PyTorch Version (e.g., 1.0): 1.9.1 
 - OS (e.g., Linux): Linux
 - How you installed PyTorch (`conda`, `pip`, source): `pip`
 - Build command you used (if compiling from source): see above
 - Python version: Python 3.9.1
 - CUDA/cuDNN version: CPU
 - GPU models and configuration: /
 - Any other relevant information:
