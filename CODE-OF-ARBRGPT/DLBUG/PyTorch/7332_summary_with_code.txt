[Title] Error msg with conv2D in pytorch 0.4

## Issue description:
got the following err msg with conv2D and ver 0.4: RuntimeError: expected stride to be a single integer value or a list of 1 values to match the convolution dimensions, but got stride=[1, 1]. 
I was not able to see the problem so I uninstalled 0.4 and installed 0.3.1
Still got an err but this time it said that the expected input should be a 4d tensor and it got a 3D tensor. 
This helped understand the issue and I fixed it (just add a dimension). reinstalled 0.4 and its working (no surprise...). I think 0.4 should have the same err feedback otherwise its really hard to undrstand the problem
