[Title] Wrong results for zero-length slices

## Issue description

Accessing tensors with zero-length slices gives wrong results.

## Code example

There are two problems that could have the same origin.

First, using zero-length slices after other slices gives the wrong result:
```python
i = slice(0)
x = torch.Tensor(range(8)).view(2, 2, 2)
x[:, i]
# Out: tensor([ 0.,  4.])
# Correct result would be: tensor([])
# Compare:
x[0, i]
# Out: tensor([])
```

Second, using zero-length slices prevents any further indexing:
```python
x[i, 0]
# RuntimeError: dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 1)
```
This is likely related to this feature request: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/5014.
