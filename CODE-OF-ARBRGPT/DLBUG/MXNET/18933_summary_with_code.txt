input = mxnet.nd.array(np.random.rand(0,1,1)) # batch = 0
gamma = mxnet.nd.array(np.random.rand(1))
beta = mxnet.nd.array(np.random.rand(1))
mxnet.ndarray.InstanceNorm(input, gamma, beta)
```

```python
import mxnet
import numpy as np

input = mxnet.nd.array(np.random.rand(1,0,1)) # channel = 0
gamma = mxnet.nd.array(np.random.rand(0))
beta = mxnet.nd.array(np.random.rand(0))
mxnet.ndarray.InstanceNorm(input, gamma, beta)
