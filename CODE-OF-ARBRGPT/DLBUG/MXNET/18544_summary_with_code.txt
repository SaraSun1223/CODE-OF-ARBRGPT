[Title] Deferred computation API returns _wrong_ data type given DeepNumpy input 

```scala
from mxnet import np, npx
from mxnet.gluon import HybridBlock

class block1(HybridBlock):
    def hybrid_forward(self, F, x):
        return x + 1

class block2(HybridBlock):
    def forward(self, x):
        return x + 1

net1 = block1()
net1.hybridize()
net2 = block2()
net2.hybridize()

print(type(net1(np.ones((2,2)))))

print(type(net2(np.ones((2,2)))))

```


Out:
```python
<class 'mxnet.numpy.ndarray'>
<class 'mxnet.ndarray.ndarray.NDArray'>
```

Not sure what the output type from forward() is supposed to be, but it should be consistent with that from hybrid_foward()
