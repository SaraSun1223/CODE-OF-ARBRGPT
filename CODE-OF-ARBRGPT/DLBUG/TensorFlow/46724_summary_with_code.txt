[Title] `tf.matmul` and `tf.tensordot` behave different in converted concrete function in TensorFlowLite 

### 1. System information

- OS Platform and Distribution: MacOS 10.15 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on Colab machine
- TensorFlow installation (pip package or built from source): pip
- TensorFlow library (version, if pip package or github SHA, if built from source): `tensorflow                    2.4.0`

### 2. Code

This notebook demonstrates the bug with the simplest example I came up with.

### 3. Failure after conversion

I implemented RFFT for TFLite using `tf.matmul` and saved the module concrete function. But invoking saved tflite model repeatedly returns different results. However, replacing `tf.matmul` with `tf.tensordot` fixes the strange behavior. Therefore, I have prepared the notebook above to demonstrate the bug. I have realized interesting cases which change the behavior:

- If negative sign is removed from output returned from `DummyMatmul` or `DummyTensordot` (`result` variable), outputs are same
- If we use `tf.Module` directly, outputs are same (colab demo shows it)
- Somehow, size of the right hand side matrix matters (colab demo shows it)
- Difference occurs after first iteration (colab demo shows it), and for some inputs it gets larger with every iteration
