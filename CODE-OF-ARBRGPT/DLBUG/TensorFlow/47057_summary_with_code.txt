[Title] Conv2D output shape becomes fully dynamic when only input batch size is dynamic in tf-nightly

### 1. System information

- OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Colab
- TensorFlow installation (pip package or built from source): pip
- TensorFlow library (version, if pip package or github SHA, if built from source): 2.4.1 v.s. nightly

### 2. Code

nightly: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r-vzh6JCIc5A4K8aYEbMZANWVrtSkKrF?usp=sharing
2.4.1: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ODMv9joqc2ybsSdNHhGq1RWKXYsnFjd-?usp=sharing

### 3. Failure after conversion

Models are correct, but nightly has fully dynamic output shape and 2.4.1 has dynamic batch dim only.

Nightly

1 here means dynamic dim (netron cannot show it precisely). It does not really matter in my use case though. Just a regression issue.
