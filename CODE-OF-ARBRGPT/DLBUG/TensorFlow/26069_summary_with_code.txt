[Title] Many operations don't support uint64

**Describe the current behavior**

I've encountered several operations that support int64 but not uint64, without any clear reasoning. `tf.equal`, `tf.fill`, `tf.where`, and `tf.stack`, for example, give errors like:

    InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Pack' used by node stack (defined at <stdin>:4) with these attrs: [T=DT_UINT64, axis=0, N=2]


**Describe the expected behavior**

Functions that work for int64s should also work for uint64s when the behavior would be the same.
