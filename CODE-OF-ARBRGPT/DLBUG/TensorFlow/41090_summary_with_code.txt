I'm trying to write a custom keras layer that uses `segment_prod` on model features, i.e., not the batch dimension. To do that, I've been using tf.transpose to put the feature dimensions first, and then transposing the resulting calculation. Forward calculation seems to work using this approach, but there appears to be an issue with gradients with `segment_prod`: the following code fails with `LookupError: gradient registry has no entry for: SegmentProd`:

```python
class MyLayer1(layers.Layer):

  def call(self, inputs):

    segments = tf.constant([0, 0, 0, 1, 1])
    return tf.transpose(
        tf.math.segment_prod(tf.transpose(inputs), segments))

inputs = layers.Input(10)
embed = layers.Embedding(20, 5)(inputs)
output = MyLayer1()(embed)
output = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(output)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, output)

X = np.random.randint(20, size=(100, 10))
y = np.random.randn(100,2)

model.compile(loss='mae')
model.fit(X, y)
```


Replacing `tf.math.segment_prod` with other operations, like `tf.math.unsorted_segment_prod(..., num_segments=2)` or `tf.math.segment_sum` seems to work, however.
