[Title] tf.raw_ops.PopulationCount for uint32 not supported but documented

**System information**

- OS Platform and Distribution:  (Intel Linux Ubuntu 20.04):
- TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): python pip
- TensorFlow version: '2.4.1'
- Python version: Python 3.8.6
- CPU

**Describe the current behavior**
tf.raw_ops.PopulationCount of array with type uint32 fails.

**Describe the expected behavior**
In api documentation for raw_ops.PopulationCount for Arg x: 
A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64. 

So this is either a documentation error or more likely a bug, because feature is important on uint32.

**Standalone code to reproduce the issue**
a = numpy.array([3], dtype = numpy,uint32)
tf.raw_ops.PopulationCount(x=a)

**Other info / logs** Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
