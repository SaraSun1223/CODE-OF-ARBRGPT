[Title] [DLPack] DLPack doesn't work with int32 on gpu

Reproduce code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kwR_ZVutSot7yA7FqPUvCsKgXcirmNLh?pli=1#scrollTo=UI-LuV7EUick

Error message on my machine:
```python
2020-07-11 14:42:25.598880: E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:1037] failed to enqueue async memcpy from device to host: CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE: invalid argument; host dst: 0x1abfd2c0; GPU src: 0x1a027e80; size: 12=0xc
2020-07-11 14:42:25.598954: F tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_util.cc:291] GPU->CPU Memcpy failed
```

It seems the int32 tensor's data pointer is on cpu instead of being on gpu, althought its device is "gpu". Previously as I know there's special case handling for int32 tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/34071), not sure whether this is related.

And I just found I used constant_op.constant to test dlpacks, which means now it only test the case on cpu since tf.constant always place data on host memory

Do you have any idea on this issue? @sanjoy @alextp
