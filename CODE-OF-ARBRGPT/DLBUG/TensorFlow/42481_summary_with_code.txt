[Title] TensorFlow Lite converter emits incorrect mask for StridedSlice when using ellipsis

**System information**
- OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux, Ubuntu 18.04
- TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
- TensorFlow version (or github SHA if from source): tf-nightly-cpu-2.4.0.dev20200818

**Command used to run the converter or code if you’re using the Python API**
```python
import tensorflow as tf


def main():
    graph = tf.Graph()

    # Create a basic graph with only an overlap_and_add on some random data.
    shape = (1, 1, 1024, 512)
    with graph.as_default():
        _input = tf.random.uniform(shape)
        ola = tf.signal.overlap_and_add(_input, 256, name='output')

    # Try executing that graph in regular TensorFlow.
    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as session:
        print(f"With regular TensorFlow, result is: {session.run(ola)}")

    # Convert to TFLite (using the V1 interface for simplicity)
    converter = tf.compat.v1.lite.TFLiteConverter(graph.as_graph_def(), [_input], [ola])
    tflite_model = converter.convert()

    # Write the model to disk...
    model_path = f'./{__file__}.tflite'
    with open(model_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(tflite_model)

    # ...so that we can load it into an interpreter and see the error!
    interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path=model_path)
    interpreter.allocate_tensors()

    # This line should throw (as of tf-nightly-cpu-2.4.0.dev20200818):
    #   RuntimeError: tensorflow/lite/kernels/reshape.cc:66 \
    #   num_input_elements != num_output_elements (0 != 524800) \
    #   Node number 5 (RESHAPE) failed to prepare.
    interpreter.invoke()
    print("If we got here, the bug did not appear!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

**Failure details**
The provided graph works in regular TensorFlow, and the TensorFlow Lite converter executes with no errors, but the TFLite model fails at runtime with:
```
RuntimeError: tensorflow/lite/kernels/reshape.cc:66 num_input_elements != num_output_elements (0 != 524800)Node number 5 (RESHAPE) failed to prepare.
```

A visualization of the resulting graph in Netron shows that the node in question should have an input shape of `(1, 1, 2050, 256)` with no unknown dimensions:
