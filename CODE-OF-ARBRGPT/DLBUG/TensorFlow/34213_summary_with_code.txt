- OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Fedora Server 31
- TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source (master branch, commit 73a34133f6a414a03e54971f4975584c3d6251cc), identical on both machines
- TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.12.1-17924-g73a34133f6 2.0.0

To compile on Fedora 31 I did need to use a grpc version patch, this patch can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33758#issuecomment-547867642) in issue #33758. It consists of running this command before compiling tensorflow.
```
curl -L https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/compare/master...hi-ogawa:grpc-backport-pr-18950.patch | git apply
```

bazel configured with Python 3 directory, and default otherwise.
bazel build command used is as follows
```
bazel build --config=mkl --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
```
