Problem traced to:
tensorflow.python.lib.io.file_io, line 532, function atomic_write_string_to_file

From debugging, tensorflow attempts to create, then overwrite a file while saving a checkpoint.  For some reason, the 'overwrite' parameter, although set to True, does nothing.  This causes the rename to fail (since the file seems to get created earlier in the checkpoint save process).

We tried deleting the 'checkpoint' file before the 'save', but the checkpoint file that it's trying to overwrite appears to be created as a part of the 'save' call.

I was able to get checkpoint saving working again by modifying atomic_write_string_to_file as follows.  My change checks for existence of the rename target and deletes it using os.remove if overwrite is True, rather than relying on the tensorflow custom machinery that doesn't seem to be working:

```python
def atomic_write_string_to_file(filename, contents, overwrite=True):
  if not has_atomic_move(filename):
    write_string_to_file(filename, contents)
  else:
    temp_pathname = filename + ".tmp" + uuid.uuid4().hex
    write_string_to_file(temp_pathname, contents)
    try:
      if overwrite and os.path.exists(filename):
        os.remove(filename)
      rename(temp_pathname, filename, overwrite)
    except errors.OpError:
      delete_file(temp_pathname)
      raise
```

The stack trace we got suggested that this is the same issue as someone was reporting for tensorflow.models:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/4177

**Describe the expected behavior**

We should be able to successfully save a checkpoint on Windows 10.
